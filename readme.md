##PS2 Form Helper for BITS Pilani



> This version was written for the BITS Pilani PS2 form during Jan-June 2015, a new updated version of this script is available at
> https://github.com/nikhilmotiani/ps2helper for the 2016 Jan-June session
> Feel free to fork and re-use the code and documentation for later Practice School 1 or 2 sessions. ðŸ¤˜


This a tool which will help you fill the PS2(Practice School 2) Preferences on the new BITS Pilani PSMS page. You will need to sort the PS stations in Excel(Or any other spreadsheet software which supports csv files) using the **given csv file** which has **Station IDs**,Names, Stipend, Location, Disciplines etc as columns.

*Please keep in mind that Station IDs are 2/3 digit numbers which are given in the csv file given here - [Problem Bank CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t27/ps2helper/master/ProbBankWithStationIDs.csv).* 

**For Version-2, follow these additional steps**

1. open [This](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t27/ps2helper/master/NewStations_forV2.csv) csv file (which contains **only the newly added stations**) in excel and copy-paste all the rows under your previously sorted excel file. You should now have 340 stations in your excel file.
2. Delete the old bookmarklet and make a new one for **Version-2** as found below.
3. Sort this new consolidated CSV file again and follow the same procedure as before(also mentioned below) to fill in your preferences

I recommend using Chrome.

This has been tested to work fine on Chrome in Windows and Ubuntu.


Thanks,

Firstly add the bookmarklet below to your bookmarks bar. (Press CTRL+SHIFT+B to display the bookmarks bar, then right click on it and click on Add Page, Change the title to whatever you want and in the url field, paste all of the below text)


```
javascript:(function(){function r(e,t,n){$.ajax({type:"POST",url:"StudentStationPreference.aspx/saveStudentStationPref",contentType:"application/json; charset=utf-8",data:'{ jsondata: "'+encodeURIComponent(e)+'", jsonvalue: "'+encodeURIComponent(t)+'",  contistation: "'+encodeURIComponent(n)+'"}',dataType:"json",success:function(e){alert("Station Preference Submitted Successfully");window.location.replace("FillProbBankSkills.aspx")}})}function i(){var e=$("#prefOrder2").val();alert(e)}function s(){var e=$("#prefOrder2").val().split("\n");jsondata="[";var t=true;if(e.length!=340){alert("Didnt find Exactly 340 stations!");return}for(var n=0;n<e.length;n++){if(!e[n].match(/^\d+$/)){alert("Found non numeric value in pasted data!");return}jsondata+="{";jsondata+="'isActive':'1',";jsondata+="'PreferenceNo':'"+(n+1)+"','StationId':'"+e[n]+"',";jsondata+="'Accommodation':'"+t+"',";jsondata+="},"}jsondata=jsondata.substr(0,jsondata.length-1);jsondata+="]";var i="";var s=0;r(jsondata,i,s)}function o(){(window.myBookmarklet=function(){var e=document.createElement("input");e.setAttribute("type","button");e.setAttribute("value","Submit");e.setAttribute("class","btn btn-primary");e.setAttribute("id","submitPrefs");var t=document.createElement("textarea");t.setAttribute("rows","2");t.setAttribute("id","prefOrder2");if(document.getElementById("submitPrefs")==null){document.getElementById("btnSave").parentNode.insertBefore(t,null);document.getElementById("btnSave").parentNode.insertBefore(e,null);document.getElementById("submitPrefs").onclick=s}else{alert("You Only Click Once")}})()}var e="1.3.2";if(window.jQuery===undefined||window.jQuery.fn.jquery<e){var t=false;var n=document.createElement("script");n.src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/"+e+"/jquery.min.js";n.onload=n.onreadystatechange=function(){if(!t&&(!this.readyState||this.readyState=="loaded"||this.readyState=="complete")){t=true;o()}};document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(n)}else{o()}})();

```

To ensure you can update easily, I'll change the version number below everytime the bookmarklet code is updated. Remember the version you have(TIP: Put it in the Bookmark Title) and update the URL if needed.

`Version No: 2`

Changes in version 2 

Added compatibility for the new stations. Now the total number is 340.

------


1. Sort the [Problem Bank CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t27/ps2helper/master/ProbBankWithStationIDs.csv) according to your preferences in a software of your choice(Excel or otherwise).
2. Login on the PSMS site and go to the preferences page
3. Once the page loads completely, click on the previously created bookmark in your bookmarks bar
4. You should see a text box and a button appear below the Save preferences button.
5. Now copy the Station Id column from your sorted csv list and paste it into the text box. 
    *Ensure that you dont copy the column title, and that your cursor ends on the last number and NOT on a new line*
6. Each Station ID should be on a **new line**(default nature of a copy from excel)
7. Now click on the Submit button, all your acco fields will be ticked for you!
8. You'll get a popup confirming the submission.
9. Now refresh your preferences page and see the result!

This project is a result of me losing my list of 312 sorted companies multiple times (sorted according to preference for the 6 month internship - Practice School 2(PS2)) due to the buggy "Drag and Drop Interface" provided in the PSMS(Practice School Management System) site by the PS Division. I don't intend to damage or harm any systems. This script runs completely in the Users browser.
